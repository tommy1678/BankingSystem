One of the extra files that I added is NewLauncher, which is essentially the ProgramLauncher except it launches one of the methods 
from p1 to actually start the command line interface; to start the program, you would run NewLauncher instead of ProgramLauncher.A few problems to 
note is that in the newCustomer() method, it says that an error has occurred but it still inputs it into the database. Another problem is that 
some of the errors are not handled smoothly so it may cause the program to crash. To test p1.java, comment out p1.startMenu() in NewLauncher.java.
